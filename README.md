# Container_Terminal_Simulation
This project simulates the operations of a port terminal using SimPy, focusing on the unloading process of containers from vessels using cranes and trucks. The simulation models the arrival of vessels, the berthing process, the unloading of containers using cranes, and the transportation of containers by trucks.
